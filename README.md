blsky contains modules to investigate technosignature observing.  This primarily relates to rfi and drift of narrow-band signals.

satpos  implements the sgp4 orbital tracking code (http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/) and some other code to prep the data.

TLE handling
============
The TLE files are maintained in the /tle subdirectory and may be updated using the script 'updatetle.py' while in that directory.  There is a branch of this repo called tle_archive, so please update in that branch as well as the main branch.  Use a commit message of the form `TLE update 2021-12-15 11:50:10`.  The tle_archive branch gets updated weekly on Wednesday night.

May need to use tlearc.py to get TLE values of a specific epoch from space-track.org.


Install - must be in blsky install directory
=======
1 - `pip install .`
2 - `install_satpos_exe.py`

Before you run
==============
1 - make sure TLE file(s) are what you want (see above)
2 - make sure the location information is there as desired
    (update in satpos_obs.yaml, then run `satpos_make_obs.py` - must be in same directory)

How-to - generally need to be in directory containing satpos_obs.yaml, satpos.obs and satpos_cfg.yaml
======
1 - Edit satpos_cfg.yaml for run parameters
2 - `satpos_script.py <tlefilename>` to generate a shell script for satpos (default is 'active')
    writes:  satpos_<tlefilename>.sh:  script for satpos
3 - `satpos_<tlefilename>.sh`
4 - `viewable.py <tlefilename.sh>` will write viewable.csv and notviewable.csv and add info to the satpos files
5 - To count up a few things in the viewable/notviewable csv files
      from blsky import satcensus
      view, notview = satcensus.showdist()
      plot(view.period, '.')  # e.g.
6 - To look at an ephemeris file generated by satpos e.g. sp_active4542.out
      from blsky import sattrack
      sp = sattrack.Track('sp_active4542.out')
      sp.view()  # if you've run viewable and only want az/el/subsat you can skip
      plot(sp.D)  # e.g.
7 - To check againsts a pointing record e.g. ephem.txt (jd,az,el)
      from blsky import satspot
      ss = satspot.Satspot('ephem.txt')
      ss.get_viewable()
      ss.check_window(window=10)
